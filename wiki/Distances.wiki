#summary Calculating distances

= Calculating distances =

The size of viewpoint and the routes leading to it decrease with
increasing "distance". But how can we know the distance from a foto?

Objects closer to the bottom of the picture logically are more closer
to the viewer, how close exactly depends on the fotography angle.
Objects closer to the horizon are (theoretically) approaching infinite distance.

Each vertical pixel represents a fixed angle in
the viewer's vertical field of vision.

Given:
 * invisible angle ( = starting angle)
 * total angle of view
 * relative angle of horizon
 * the height of the spectator

It holds:
{{{
 distance = invisible distance + visible distance
 invisible distance = tangens( invisible angle ) * spectator's height
 
}}}
