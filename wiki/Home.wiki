= Introduction =

Sauron is a Virtual Tour framework for embedding realistic but
simple and thus CPU-friendly 3D effects to a web page.
It's primary application is to enable web users to enter buildings online
using their web browsers.

Since it is based entirely on HTML and Javascript,
it works without the need for further software installations,
especially without Java and Flash.

== Features ==
Major features of Sauron are, that you may attach
 * meta information
 * URLs (links)
 * pictures and
 * videos
to objects in the 3D space.
This way the user shall be given a realistic impression of a
location he may never have visited in reality.
