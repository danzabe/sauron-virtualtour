#summary Concept

= Horizon =

The vertical line in the middle of the panorama picture is called "horizon"
and assumed to divide "sky" and "floor".
This must be considered, when preparing images for panoramic view:
They need to be aligned appropriately.

= Viewpoints =

A viewpoint is a coordinate in the virtual reality. Since this framework
focusses on the virtual exploration of buildings, the third coordinate (z)
simply is the current floor number.
Currently the z coordinate will not be considered.

Viewpoints nearby each other must be visible in the appropriate panorama view.

According to their actual distance, their representation's size differs.
It is defined during tour development, the Javascript simply loads it.

= Panoramas =

Standing on a panorama viewpoint, the user
may make one complete 360° turn (after which
the view is invisibly reset to 0°).

After holding his mouse cursor motionless on the left or right side
of the picture for a short time, the view starts turning accordingly.<br/>
In a similar way, it is solved here:

= Routes =

When the cursor moves below the horizon, Sauron
assumes, that the user wants to see possible routes from
his viewpoint.
The routes show up as predefined during tour development and vanish,
as the cursor leaves to floor area.
This is realized by fading in/out a transparent image containing the paths.

= Walking =

After a viewpoint was clicked by the user, path and viewpoints vanish,
the view is smoothly turned to the predefined walk start angle and
video is played showing the walk to the selected viewpoint.
